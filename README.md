# Qt project for Euler Equations
This repository contains an older Qt-based project written in C/C++ for solving study cases derived from FORTRAN examples in Toro's Riemann Solvers and Numerical Methods for Fluid Dynamics.
It uses gnuplot to display the results.
The project demonstrates the application of numerical methods for fluid dynamics simulations as outlined in the book.
